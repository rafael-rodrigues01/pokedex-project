## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Description

Final project of my studies in React.Js where I created a pokedex that in addition to the pokemon image, some of its data comes from an api called [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React - [ JS Frontend framework for creating reactive web applications ]
- Context-API - [ React tool for sharing information between components ]
- React-Router-DOM - [ React library for creating and manipulating routes in SPAs ]
- Styled-Components - [ CSS Framework for styling web applications ]

## My process
As the first part of the challenge I thought about how to create a design to show the pokemon data in an attractive and easy to understand way, so I went to figma and there I developed the project design.
after having the design ready, I did an analysis of how to transform it into code using React as the main tool and some frameworks. Throughout the process, I found myself stuck several times, but I unlocked it with the help of God and the double dev community, which was fundamental for me to develop this challenge.

## Acquired knowledge

I learned how to work better with states in react, how to create spa pages using react-router-dom, how to work with the map and I also learned how to use the css grid to make my project more responsive without putting so many media queries

## What challenged me the most?

My biggest challenge was in controlling the flow of the code, I had a lot of difficulties with the use of the map and how to best show the components to the user. I also had difficulties in creating the design of the application but thank God I managed to develop something pleasant in my view

## Thanks

Firstly, I would like to thank God, the Virgin Mary, my guardian angel and all the saints and angels of God, who are with me on this mission of becoming a front-end developer, and I also thank the entire Dev team twice as much for their support and the discord community that made a big difference in my early career as a front-end developer.
