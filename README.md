## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.Js

## Acquired knowledge

I learned how to work better with states in react, how to create spa pages using react-router-dom, how to work with the map and I also learned how to use the css grid to make my project more responsive without putting so many media queries

## What challenged me the most?

My biggest challenge was in controlling the flow of the code, I had a lot of difficulties with the use of the map and how to best show the components to the user. I also had difficulties in creating the design of the application but thank God I managed to develop something pleasant in my view

## Thanks

Firstly, I would like to thank God, the Virgin Mary, my guardian angel and all the saints and angels of God, who are with me on this mission of becoming a front-end developer, and I also thank the entire Dev team twice as much for their support and the discord community that made a big difference in my early career as a front-end developer.
